# ExternalGalaxyAstrometry

Tools to analyse data with proper motions under the assumption that they are drawn from an external rotating disc galaxy.

This code grew out of work done for ["Gaia Data Release 2. Kinematics of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A..12G/abstract) and ["Gaia Early Data Release 3. Structure and properties of the Magellanic Clouds"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A...7G/abstract). 

Amendment to include line-of-sight velocities - currently pending - was done as part of work towards ["Kinematic analysis of the Large Magellanic Cloud using Gaia DR3"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...669A..91J/abstract).

The code has been made public for convenience of sharing. It is neither complete nor perfect and comes with no promise that it will become either.
